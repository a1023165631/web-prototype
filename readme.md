According to user feedback, the initial landing page did not generate interest in the software. The idea is to simplify the way users log in, ignoring the fact that they need a first impression to log in or use a program. Therefore, the text introduction of the software was changed to make it more conspicuous and easier for users to read, and illustrations were added to increase users' interest. For the background color from the original blue to now orange yellow, bright color can give users more motivation. According to the teacher's feedback, as the most basic structure of a web page, the navigation bar, copyright information and contact with developers, feedback function was added.

# Iteration of logo

According to users' feedback, the color of my logo does not match the background color, so I changed the logo and software name to a black and white color matching the theme.

# Iteration of Background and position of function icons

According to the feedback of users, users who are not familiar with the functions of the home page will be confused at first, and then confused. Therefore, these functions will be enlarged on the left side and background mask will be added to make it easier for users to use the software.

In the past, ICONS of music function and timer function were distributed in the upper right corner, and other functions were on the left side of the page, resulting in confusion and inconvenient for users to use, so they were unified in the function bar on the left side of the page.

# Iteration of search bar

After the function icon at the top was moved, the search bar was lengthened to make it easier for users to see the search box and content at a glance.

# Iteration of title

For the previous title, which was not easy for users to understand directly, change to a calendar that is easier for users to understand, because it mainly shows the task name and the time of the submission.

Change the page title of the due soon to emergency and use red font to warn the due assignment

# User feedback
User feedback：
Jax(A freshman majoring in accounting)
When I open the home page, I think the overall sense is not enough to attract me, and the software introduction font is not obvious enough, so I don't want to know more.The overall color including icon is not particularly conspicuous.

Abby(A sophomore majoring in design computer)
The logo design is good, but when combined with the page, it will look mismatched and not coordinated enough in terms of color. Login page is not necessary to do so big, can reduce or do click trigger, hidden features do not let the user easy to understand, when I entered the home page, I don't see a key or a hint, all ICONS including background color is similar, I will help you understand these points about the usefulness of function, It is suggested that the functions should be organized so that users can enter this page to clearly carry out each step of the operation, rather than mindless chaos

Alex(The sophomore majored in psychology)
I was confused by the title of each page, which could not directly express the function of this page.I feel confused for the title of each page, it is not very intuitive to express the function of the page, after I understand using method, comparing to the timer, it should not be appear on the home page, but the user to edit their own task, check finish, with a focus on time and rest time
