# **User feedback**
The main ways to obtain user feedback are questionnaire, telephone return visit and face-to-face communication. After my page was designed for the first time, I collected the following relevant information through communication with several users, which will be the main work part and improvement content of my subsequent iterations.
1. On the login page, users do not understand the performance and functions of the page, and the font on the page is very small, so users cannot understand the meaning of the whole page. The huge login page creates a sense of pressure for users to log in.
2. As for the color of the page, some users give feedback that they hope to change the color to a more positive and energetic color, so that they will be more active in the process of using it. Through the collection of votes, 7 students chose yellow and 3 students chose blue. Yellow is more attractive in comparison.
3. As for the Logo, through communication with many users, I found that users could not remember the style of the Logo at all. For a WEB, the Logo represents the image of a company. Therefore, the logo needs to be re-designed and edited later.

According to user feedback, when users enter the home page, they cannot clearly understand the intention and function of the website, and it is not attractive enough. The idea is to simplify the way users log in, ignoring the fact that they won't log in because of a big login box if they don't know a product. On the contrary, users may be more resistant. Therefore, the following modifications were made. The text of the software was enlarged to make it more eye-catching and easy for users to read, and illustrations were added to increase users' interest. As for the background color, from the original blue to the present orange yellow, yellow is the color of hope, which can give users more motivation when facing difficult assignments. According to the teacher's feedback, as the most basic structure of the web page, added the navigation bar, copyright information, contact with developers, feedback and other functions.

# Iteration of logo

From the perspective of Visual analysis, the previous purple background was not clear enough for users to quickly capture their attention, so it was changed to a simple white color to form a contrast color with the black rocket to highlight the visual effect.

# Iteration of Background and position of function icons

According to the user's feedback, the user who is not familiar with the home page function, will be confused first, and then disorderly click the function icon. Therefore, these features will zoom in on the left side and add a background mask to draw the user's attention and make it easier to use the software.

In the past, the icon's music function and timer function were distributed in the upper right corner, among which the timer function confused users. According to the survey, it was found that users liked to listen to music when finishing their work, so music was placed on the left as a common function, and timer function was placed on the page when users were working on a specific task.

# Iteration of search bar

Because the main function of the page is to help the user complete the job. In the process of searching, users may search for part of the assignment and locate the specific address of the assignment. Extend the search bar, help users better access to relevant information, and effective editing in the search bar. The long search bar is shorter and displays more content, making it more convenient for users to use.

# Iteration of title

For the previous title, which was not easy for users to understand directly, change to a calendar that is easier for users to understand, because it mainly shows the task name and the time of the submission.

The function page of the font itself is to remind users of the contents that need to be handed in as soon as possible. It is a countdown and reminder of the assignment. It is changed to emergency in red to better attract users' attention and enhance the effect of reminding.
